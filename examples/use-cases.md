## Overall Use‑Cases Across Languages

- **Education:** Teach parsing, string manipulation, and algorithmic thinking.  
- **CLI Tools:** Build dashboards, menus, and help screens framed with box characters.  
- **Documentation:** Auto‑generate diagrams in Markdown or HTML.  
- **Cross‑Language Comparison:** Show students how different languages handle structured data.  
- **Creative Coding:** Experiment with ASCII art, progress bars, and visualizations using block elements (`░▒▓█`).  
- **System Diagrams:** Generate ER diagrams, flowcharts, or state machines directly in text for documentation.  
- **Cross‑disciplinary teaching:** Show how the same dataset can be leveraged in multiple languages, reinforcing transferable skills.  
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Developers can sketch UI wireframes or CLI menus without needing external libraries.  
- **Automation:** Scripts can wrap logs, highlight errors, or format reports with box‑drawing characters for clarity.

## Teaching Notes

- Encourage students to **compare implementations** across languages — e.g., how Python’s string multiplication differs from Java’s `repeat()`.  
- Highlight the **importance of structured data** (JSON/YAML/CSV) as a foundation for automation.  
- Use these examples to teach **string manipulation, loops, and conditionals** in a visually engaging way.  
- Show how **different categories** (light, heavy, double, arc, block) can be swapped programmatically to change the “style” of output.  
- Assign exercises like:  
  - “Write a function that draws a box around any string.”  
  - “Generate a directory tree diagram from a nested object.”  
  - “Build a progress bar using block elements.”

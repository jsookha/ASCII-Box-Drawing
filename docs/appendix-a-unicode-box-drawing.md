# 📚 Appendix A — Full Unicode Range U+2500–U+257F

## Introduction

The Unicode block **U+2500–U+257F** contains the complete set of box‑drawing characters. These symbols were designed to allow text‑based terminals to render structured diagrams without graphics.  

Understanding the full set is useful for:

- Matching corners and edges when designing complex diagrams  
- Teaching students how different families of characters interrelate  
- Building programmatic generators that can switch styles dynamically  
- Ensuring compatibility across platforms and fonts  

This appendix groups the characters into families for easier navigation.  
Where relevant, related blocks (shading and geometric shapes) are also included.

## H. Geometric Shapes (Optional Add‑On)

Although outside the U+2500–U+257F block, the **Geometric Shapes** range (U+25A0–U+25FF) often complements box‑drawing characters. These include squares, circles, triangles, and diamonds, which can be used for:

- Node markers in diagrams  
- Bullets in decision tables  
- Visual emphasis in CLI dashboards  

Examples:

| Symbol | Code   | Name                  |
| ------ | ------ | --------------------- |
| ■      | U+25A0 | BLACK SQUARE          |
| □      | U+25A1 | WHITE SQUARE          |
| ▲      | U+25B2 | BLACK UP‑POINTING TRIANGLE |
| ▼      | U+25BC | BLACK DOWN‑POINTING TRIANGLE |
| ◆      | U+25C6 | BLACK DIAMOND         |
| ◇      | U+25C7 | WHITE DIAMOND         |
| ●      | U+25CF | BLACK CIRCLE          |
| ○      | U+25CB | WHITE CIRCLE          |

## Teaching Notes

- **Grouping matters:** Students often confuse light vs heavy vs double lines. Presenting them side‑by‑side clarifies usage.  
- **Mixed joints:** These are advanced but powerful for emphasizing headers or borders. Encourage experimentation.  
- **Arc corners and diagonals:** Useful for softer UI mockups or flow diagrams.  
- **Block elements:** Ideal for progress bars, shading, or simple bar charts.  
- **Geometric shapes:** Extend the visual vocabulary beyond boxes, enabling richer diagrams.

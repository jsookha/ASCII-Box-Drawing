### Purpose
Serverless diagrams illustrate event‑driven compute, function orchestration, and managed services. They help teams understand how to build scalable systems without managing servers.

### Example — Basic Serverless Flow
```
Event → Function → Database
```

### Example — Orchestrated Workflow
```
Step 1 → Lambda A
Step 2 → Lambda B
Step 3 → Lambda C
```

### Example — API Gateway + Functions
```
Client → API Gateway → Function → DB
```

### Example — Event Stream Processing
```
Producer → Stream → Function → Data Lake
```
